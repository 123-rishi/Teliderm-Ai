TelidermAI is an AI-powered application that allows users to interact with PDF documents using natural language queries and perform image classification on medical images. It leverages Google's Gemini AI for text-based queries and a deep learning model for image predictions.

##  Features

###  Chat with PDFs
- Upload medical PDFs (e.g., dermatology textbooks, research papers, reports).
- Ask natural language queries to extract relevant medical information.
- Uses **LangChain** for document processing and embedding.

###  Image Prediction
- Upload an image of a skin condition.
- AI model classifies the disease based on deep learning predictions.
- Uses **ResNet50** and **EfficientNetB0** for enhanced accuracy.

###  FAISS Vector Database
- Stores text embeddings from PDFs for efficient retrieval.
- Enables rapid search and Q&A functionalities.

###  AI-Powered Chatbot
- Answers dermatology-related queries based on trained knowledge.
- Leverages **Google Gemini AI** for natural language understanding.
